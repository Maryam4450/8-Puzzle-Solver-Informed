# 🧩 8 Puzzle Solver using Best-First Search & A* Algorithm (Python)

This project solves the classic **8 Puzzle Game** using two well-known search algorithms:
- 🔍 **Best-First Search**
- 🌟 **A\* (A-Star) Search Algorithm**

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file to allow easy comparison of their performance and logic.

## 🧠 What is the 8 Puzzle?

The 8 Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered 1 through 8 and one empty space (`0`). The objective is to move the tiles around to match the **goal state** by sliding them into the empty space.

Example Goal State:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
